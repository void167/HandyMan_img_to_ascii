# HandyMan_img_to_ascii
Bot based on PILLOW library, does exactly what its name says.

Basically reads a grayscale of an individual pixel of uploaded image and puts a symbol which equals a level of grayscale of this pixel.

Runs on PythonAnywhere (tell me nothing ik it sucks)

You can try it yourself on PC ( preferably ) via this TG username @hand_y_man_bot
